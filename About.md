# Adversarial Attacks in ML based Remote Sensing applications

With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, it is used in every part of our life, e.g., finance, security system, autonomous vehicle, cybersecurity, and transportation system. But attackers can also manipulate this AI technology with specially crafted input. The Adversarial example is one of the earliest adversarial attacks in AI models where an attacker can craft a poison sample during the inference phase. Usually, the object of the attacker is to hide objects from AI- based detectors. This might create a catastrophic effect on many security-critical systems. Government organizations, such as US Navy, US Army, and many private sectors, e.g., Uber and Google, use remote sensing data. Satellite imagery, one of the most popular remote sensing products, is widely used to monitor objects remotely. In this project, Students will explore the potential vulnerabilities of the AI models in remote sensing-based AI models and developing mitigation techniques.
